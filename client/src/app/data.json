        "body": "I was rejected by Intuit (twice), Goldman Sachs, and more, before cracking Amazon or Moengage. Working professionals often get demotivated by the rejections they had to go through to get to their dream product-based company. But, what I have realized is, we have to take these rejections as an opportunity to learn, and become better. And through these rejections, I’ve learned a lot. 👍 I learned how to be Consistent. 👍 Focused on following a structured approach rather than running behind an ocean of resources. 👍 Figured out what works for me and what does not. 👍 Lastly, learned to say ‘No’ to all the distractions that came my way. I realized that a sudden burst of motivation was not going to take me anywhere, but I needed to work hard for my dream company. And thanks to my mentors who guided me along the way, and provided me constructive feedback forcing me to improve myself. So, if you’re passionate about landing a job at a great product company, you can take the help of platforms like Bosscoder Academy. Check them here: https://bit.ly/3NiUBmi They can help you with : ✅ Structured curriculum to learn problem-solving in DSA, System Design and Full stack development. ✅ Personal Mentorship from industry experts. ✅ Live Classes & 24/7 Doubt Support. ✅ Real-life, relevant projects with Placement Assistance Failures are just a stepping-stone to your goals, and we need to embrace that and learn from it.",

        "title": "Science of how fat loss depends on our Sleep",
        "body": "Here's the science of how fat loss depends on our sleep: Fat loss is mainly dependent on our cellular health and hormones. Sleep allows our cells to get rid of toxins. So, if we sleep well, our cells will automatically start to get rid of extra fat. Studies suggest that adults who slept less than 7 hours each night were 41% more likely to become obese. This happens due to 4 main reasons. 1) Appetite regulating hormones Leptin signals your brain that you are full and ghrelin signals to your brain that you are still hungry. By sleeping for less than 7 hours, leptin goes up by 18% and ghrelin goes up by 28%. So, there is a dual effect on hunger. Your cravings for carbs like sugar, bread, pasta, rice, roti, deserts, etc, and salty food will increase significantly. 2) Changes in the brain If you sleep less than 7 hours, your hedonic (pleasure-seeking) desires increase and impulse control decreases significantly. So, if you have the option of healthy and unhealthy food in front, you will only go for the tastier ones. 3) Cortisol and insulin Fat gain-loss is mainly governed by the hormones cortisol and insulin. Sleep deprivation increases our cortisol levels chronically. Cortisol is a stress hormone. Cortisol makes our body store fat to prepare us for future dangers. Chronically high cortisol levels also increase our blood sugar levels significantly & make us more insulin-resistant. Now, it forms a deadly high insulin-cortisol combination which rapidly increases belly fat storage and makes it very difficult for our body to lose fat. 4) Fat vs muscle loss If you are in calorie deficit, and not sleeping sufficiently, up to 60% of your weight loss will be muscle mass. Mainly because sleep deprivation decreases our testosterone levels, and increases cortisol levels. Both of these factors significantly contribute to muscle loss. ------------ If your goal is to lose fat, sleep is one of the most important pillars that you need to focus on. All the best! Save for later. If you found it helpful, repost it or share it with someone who might benefit from it.",
